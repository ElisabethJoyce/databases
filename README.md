# Introduction to Databases

A database is a collection of data that is structured to allow for manipulation. This session will introduce one type of database, the relational database, using SQLite, a portable implementation often used in mobile phones and distributed systems.

After completing this session, attendees will be able to: 

- Create database tables in an SQLite database using Python and SQL statements
- Insert, read, and delete data 
- Understand the beginning of cleaning/tidying data
